I’m a B.E. CSE (AI & ML) student at Chandigarh University. Passionate about Machine Learning and building cool projects. This is one of my beginner-level ML projects to learn and showcase skills.
# 🏡 House Price Prediction Web App

This project is a simple and powerful **Machine Learning** web application that predicts the price of a house based on input features using **Linear Regression**. It is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and deployed using **Streamlit** for easy interaction.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Build a regression model to predict house prices.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
- Deploy the model with an interactive web interface using Streamlit.
- Enable real-time predictions based on user input.
